- Will be replaced with the ToC, excluding the "Contents" header
{:toc}

I've written before about [static analysis](/blog/categories/static-analysis/), but in those earlier posts I wasn't able to give specific examples of real-world code where static analysis is able to discover latent errors.

In the earlier articles I used a synthetic code-base [from ITC Research](https://github.com/regehr/itc-benchmarks) to test clang, cppcheck and PVS-Studio.  I also ran all three tools on the code-bases that I'm responsible for maintaining at my "day job", but I wasn't able to share detailed results from that analysis, given that the code is not public.

In this article, I want to expand the discussion of static analysis by diving into a real-world, open-source code base that I've been working with lately, with specific examples of the kinds of problems static analysis can expose.

<!-- more -->


## OpenMAMA
For this example, I'll be using the [OpenMAMA](http://openmama.org) source code.  OpenMAMA is an open-source messaging middleware framework that provides a high-level API for a bunch of messaging transports, including open-source (Qpid/AMQP, ZeroMQ) and commercial (DataFabric, Rendezvous, Solace, etc).

OpenMAMA is an interesting project -- it started back in 2004 with Wombat Financial Software, which was attempting to sell its market-data software, but found it to be tough sledding.  While Wombat's software performed better and was less expensive than Tibco's Rendezvous (the de-facto standard at the time), no one wanted to rewrite their applications to target an API from a small company that might not be around in a couple of years.

So Wombat developed an open API which could sit on top of any messaging middleware, and they called it MAMA, for Middleware Agnostic Messaging API.  They also developed bindings for Rendezvous, in addition to their own software, so that prospective customers would have a warm and fuzzy feeling that they could write their applications once, and seamlessly switch out the underlying middleware software with little or no changes to their code.

That strategy worked well enough that in 2008 Wombat was acquired by the New York Stock Exchange, which renamed the software "Data Fabric" and used it as the backbone of their market-data network (SuperFeed).

When the company I was working for was also acquired by NYSE in 2009 I was tasked with replacing our existing middleware layer with the Mama/Wombat middleware, and in the process I came to appreciate the "pluggable" architecture of MAMA -- it doesn't make the issues related to different messaging systems go away, but it does provide a framework for dealing with them.

In 2011 NYSE Technologies donated OpenMAMA to the Linux Foundation.  Then, in 2014, the Wombat business was sold by NYSE to [Vela Trading Technologies](https://www.velatradingtech.com/) (n√©e SR Labs), which provides the proprietary Data Fabric middleware, and is also the primary maintainer for OpenMAMA.  There are a number of different [open-source and commercial implementations of OpenMAMA](http://www.openmama.org/what-is-openmama/supported-software).

Which brings us to the present day -- I've recently started working with OpenMAMA again, so it seemed like a good idea to use that code as an example of how to use static analysis tools to identify latent bugs.

And, just to be clear, this is not a criticism of OpenMAMA -- it's an impressive piece of work, and has proven itself in demanding real-world situations.  

## Following along

The analysis presented here is based on OpenMAMA release 6.2.1, which can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/releases/tag/OpenMAMA-6.2.1-release).

I used [cppcheck version 1.80](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) and [clang version 5.0.0](http://releases.llvm.org/download.html#5.0.0).

Check out the [earlier articles in this series](/blog/categories/static-analysis/) for more on building and running the various tools, including a bunch of helper scripts in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static).

For the OpenMAMA analysis, I first built OpenMAMA using [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear) to create a compilation database from the scons build:  

~~~bash
bear scons blddir=build product=mama with_unittest=n \
middleware=qpid with_testtools=n with_docs=n
~~~

With the compilation database in place, I ran the following scripts[^tools], redirecting their output to create the result files:

~~~bash
cc_cppcheck.sh -i common/c_cpp/src/c/ -i mama/c_cpp/src/c/ -c cc_clangcheck.sh -i common/c_cpp/src/c/ -i mama/c_cpp/src/c/ -c cc_clangtidy.sh -i common/c_cpp/src/c/ -i mama/c_cpp/src/c/ -c 
~~~

The results from running the tools on OpenMAMA can also be found in [the repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static/tree/master/openmama), along with a `compile_commands.json` file that can be used without the need to build OpenMAMA from source[^mamabuild].  To do that, use the following commands:

    cd [directory]
    git clone https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA.git
    git clone https://github.com/btorpey/static.git
    export PATH=$(/bin/pwd)/static/scripts:$PATH
    cp static/openmama/* OpenMAMA
    cd OpenMAMA
    cc_cppcheck.sh -i common/c_cpp/src/c/ -i mama/c_cpp/src/c/ -c 

I use the wonderful [Beyond Compare](/blog/2013/01/29/beyond-compare/) to, well, compare the results from different tools.

[^tools]: Simply clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static) to any directory, and then add the `scripts` directory to your `PATH`.

[^mamabuild]: OpenMAMA has its share of prerequisites -- you can get a full list [here](https://openmama.github.io/openmama_build_instructions.html).

## False Positives
Before we do anything else, let's deal with the elephant in the room -- false positives.  As in, warning messages for code that is actually perfectly fine.  Apparently, a lot of people have been burned by "lint"-type programs with terrible signal-to-noise ratios.  I know -- I've been there too.

Well, let me be clear -- these are not your father's lints.  I've been running these tools on a lot of real-world code for a while now, and there are essentially  NO false positives.  If one of these tools complains about some code, there's something wrong with it, and you really want to fix it.

## Style vs. Substance
cppcheck includes a lot of "style" checks, although the term can be misleading  -- there are a number of "style" issues that can have a significant impact on quality.

One of them crops up all over the place in OpenMAMA code, and that is the "The scope of the variable '\<name>' can be reduced" messages.  The reason for these is because of OpenMAMA's insistence on K&R-style variable declarations (i.e., all block-local variables must be declared before any executable statements).  Which, in turn, is caused by OpenMAMA's decision to support several old and broken Microsoft compilers[^vs].

[^vs]: The list of supported platforms for OpenMAMA is [here](https://openmama.github.io/openmama_supported_platforms.html).  You can also find a lot of griping on the intertubes about Microsoft's refusal to support C99, including [this rather weak response](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-ide/suggestions/2089423-c99-support) from Herb Sutter.  Happily, VS 2013 ended up supporting (most of) C99\. 

The consensus has come to favor declaring variables as close to first use as possible, and that is part of the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#es21-dont-introduce-a-variable-or-constant-before-you-need-to-use-it).  The only possible down-side to this approach is that it makes it easier to inadvertently declare "shadow" variables (i.e., variables with the same name in both inner and outer scopes), but modern compilers can flag shadow variables, which mitigates this potential problem (see my earlier article ["Who Knows What Evil Lurks..."](/blog/2015/03/17/shadow/) for more).

Some other "style" warnings produced by cppcheck include:

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/bridge/qpid/transport.c:1413]: (style) Consecutive return, break, continue, goto or throw statements are unnecessary.

These are mostly benign, but reflect a lack of understanding of what statements like `continue` and `return` do, and can be confusing.
<br>
<br>

> \[common/c_cpp/src/c/list.c:295 -> common/c_cpp/src/c/list.c:298]: (style) Variable 'rval' is reassigned a value before the old one has been used.

There are a lot of these in OpenMAMA, and most of them are probably caused by the unfortunate decision to standardize on K&R-style local variable declarations, but in other cases this can point to a potential logic problem.  (Another good reason to avoid K&R-style declarations).

<br>
Similar, but potentially more serious is this one:

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/bridge/qpid/transport.c:275]: (style) Variable 'next' is assigned a value that is never used.

Maybe the variable was used in an earlier version of the code, but is no longer needed.  Or maybe we ended up using the wrong variable when we mean to use `next`.

## Dead Code

There are also cases where the analyzer can determine that the code as written is meaningless

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/bridge/qpid/subscription.c:179]: (style) A pointer can not be negative so it is either pointless or an error to check if it is.

If something cannot happen, there is little point to testing for it -- so testing for impossible conditions is almost always a sign that something is wrong with the code.

Here are a few more of the same ilk:

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/dictionary.c:323]: (style) Checking if unsigned variable '*size' is less than zero.

<!-- -->
> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/statslogger.c:731]: (style) Condition 'status!=MAMA_STATUS_OK' is always false

<!-- -->
> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/dqstrategy.c:543]: (style) Redundant condition: If 'EXPR == 3', the comparison 'EXPR != 2' is always true.

Whether these warnings represent real bugs is a question that needs to be answered on a case-by-case basis, but I hope we can agree that they at the very least represent a ["code smell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell), and the fewer of these in our code, the better.

## Buffer Overflow
There are bugs, and there are bugs, but bugs that have a "delayed reaction", are arguably the worst, partly because they can be so hard to track down.  Buffer overflows are a major cause of these kinds of bugs -- a buffer overflow can trash return addresses on the stack causing a crash, or worse they can alter the program's flow in ways that seem completely random.

Here's an example of a buffer overflow in OpenMAMA that was detected by cppcheck:

> \[common/c_cpp/src/c/strutils.c:632]: (error) Array 'version.mExtra[16]' accessed at index 16, which is out of bounds.


Here's the offending line of code:

~~~
    version->mExtra[VERSION_INFO_EXTRA_MAX] = '\0';
~~~


And here's the declaration:

~~~c
    char mExtra[VERSION_INFO_EXTRA_MAX];
~~~


It turns out that this particular bug was fixed subsequent to the release -- the bug report is [here](https://github.com/OpenMAMA/OpenMAMA/pull/310).  Interestingly, the bug report mentions that the bug was found using clang's Address Sanitizer,  which means that code must have been executed to expose the bug.     Static analyzers like cppcheck can detect this bug without the need to run the code, which is a big advantage of static analysis.  In this example, cppcheck can tell at compile-time that the access is out-of-bounds, since it knows the size of mExtra.

Of course, a static analyzer like cppcheck can't detect *all* buffer overflows -- just the ones that can be evaluated at compile-time.  So, we still need Address Sanitizer, or valgrind, or some other run-time analyzer, to detect overflows that depend on the run-time behavior of the program.  But I'll take all the help I can get, and detecting at least some of these nasty bugs at compile-time is a win.

## NULL pointer dereference
In contrast to the buffer overflow type of problem, dereferencing a NULL pointer is not mysterious at all -- you're going down hard, right now.

So, reasonable programmers insert checks for NULL pointers, but reasonable is not the same as perfect, and sometimes we get it wrong.

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/msg.c:3619] -> [mama/c_cpp/src/c/msg.c:3617]: (warning, inconclusive) Either the condition '!impl' is redundant or there is possible null pointer dereference: impl.

Here's a snip of the code in question -- see if you can spot the problem:

~~~c
3613    mamaMsgField
3614    mamaMsgIterator_next (mamaMsgIterator iterator)
3615    {
3616        mamaMsgIteratorImpl* impl         = (mamaMsgIteratorImpl*)iterator;
3617        mamaMsgFieldImpl*    currentField = (mamaMsgFieldImpl*) impl->mCurrentField;
3618
3619        if (!impl)
3620            return (NULL);
~~~

cppcheck works similarly to other static analyzers when checking for possible NULL pointer dereference -- it looks to see if a pointer is checked for NULL, and if it is, looks for code that dereferences the pointer outside the scope of that check.

In this case, the code checks for `impl` being NULL, but not until it has already dereferenced the pointer.  cppcheck even helpfully ties together the check for NULL and the (earlier) dereference. (Ahem -- yet another reason to avoid K&R-style declarations).

## Leaks
Similarly to checking for NULL pointers, detecting leaks is more of a job for valgrind, Address Sanitizer or some other run-time analysis tool.  However, that doesn't mean that static analysis can't give us a head-start on getting rid of our leaks.

For instance, cppcheck has gotten quite clever about being able to infer run-time behavior at compile-time, as in this example:

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/transport.c:269]: (error) Memory leak: transport
<br>
> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/transport.c:278]: (error) Memory leak: transport
Here's the code:

~~~c
253 mama_status
254 mamaTransport_allocate (mamaTransport* result)
255 {
256     transportImpl*  transport    =   NULL;
257     mama_status     status       =   MAMA_STATUS_OK;
258
259
260     transport = (transportImpl*)calloc (1, sizeof (transportImpl ) );
261     if (transport == NULL)  return MAMA_STATUS_NOMEM;
262
263     /*We need to create the throttle here as properties may be set
264      before the transport is actually created.*/
265     if (MAMA_STATUS_OK!=(status=wombatThrottle_allocate (&self->mThrottle)))
266     {
267         mama_log (MAMA_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR, "mamaTransport_allocate (): Could not"
268                   " create throttle.");
269         return status;
270     }
271
272     wombatThrottle_setRate (self->mThrottle,
273                            MAMA_DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATE);
274
275     if (MAMA_STATUS_OK !=
276        (status = wombatThrottle_allocate (&self->mRecapThrottle)))
277     {
278         return status;
279     }
280
281     wombatThrottle_setRate (self->mRecapThrottle,
282                             MAMA_DEFAULT_RECAP_THROTTLE_RATE);
283
284     self->mDescription          = NULL;
285     self->mLoadBalanceCb        = NULL;
286     self->mLoadBalanceInitialCb = NULL;
287     self->mLoadBalanceHandle    = NULL;
288     self->mCurTransportIndex    = 0;
289     self->mDeactivateSubscriptionOnError = 1;
290     self->mGroupSizeHint        = DEFAULT_GROUP_SIZE_HINT;
291     *result = (mamaTransport)transport;
292
293     self->mName[0] = '\0';
294
295     return MAMA_STATUS_OK;
296 }
~~~

cppcheck is able to determine that the local variable `transport` is never assigned in the two early returns, and thus can never be freed.
<br>

Not to be outdone, clang-tidy is doing some kind of flow analysis that allows it to catch this one:

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/queue.c:778]: warning: Use of memory after it is freedHere's a snip of the code that clang-tidy is complaining about:

~~~ c
651 mama_status652 mamaQueue_destroy (mamaQueue queue)653 {654     mamaQueueImpl* impl = (mamaQueueImpl*)queue;655     mama_status    status = MAMA_STATUS_OK;...776         free (impl);777778         mama_log (MAMA_LOG_LEVEL_FINEST, "Leaving mamaQueue_destroy for queue 0x%X.", queue);779         status = MAMA_STATUS_OK;780     }781782    return status;783 }
~~~
clang-tidy understands that `queue` and `impl` are aliases for the same variable, and thus knows that it is illegal to access `queue` after `impl` has been freed.  In this case, the access causes no problems, because we're only printing the address, but clang-tidy can't know that[^interproc].

[^interproc]: Unless it knows what `mama_log` does.  It turns out that clang-tidy can do inter-procedural analysis, but only within a single translation unit.  There is some work ongoing to add support for analysis across translation units by G√°bor Horvath et al. -- for more see ["Cross Translational Unit Analysis in Clang Static Analyzer: Prototype and Measurements"](http://llvm.org/devmtg/2017-03//2017/02/20/accepted-sessions.html#7).


## Pointer Errors
I've <del>ranted</del> written [before](/blog/2014/09/23/into-the-void/) on how much I hate `void*`'s.  For better or worse, the core OpenMAMA code is written in C, so there are a whole bunch of casts between `void*`s and "real" pointers that have the purpose of encapsulating the internal workings of the internal objects managed by the code.

In C this is about the best that can be done, but it can be hard to keep things straight, which can be a source of errors (like this one):

> \[mama/c_cpp/src/c/fielddesc.c:76]: (warning) Assignment of function parameter has no effect outside the function. Did you forget dereferencing it?And here's the code:

~~~ c
65  mama_status66  mamaFieldDescriptor_destroy (mamaFieldDescriptor descriptor)67  {68      mamaFieldDescriptorImpl* impl = (mamaFieldDescriptorImpl*) descriptor;6970      if (impl == NULL)71          return MAMA_STATUS_OK;7273      free (impl->mName);74      free (impl);7576      descriptor = NULL;77      return MAMA_STATUS_OK;78  }
~~~

Of course `mamaFieldDescriptor` is defined as a `void*`, so it's perfectly OK to set it to NULL, but since it's passed by value, the assignment has no effect other than to zero out the copy of the parameter on the stack.

## But Wait, There's More!
The preceding sections go into detail about specific examples of serious errors detected by cppcheck and clang.  But, these are very much the tip of the iceberg.

Some of the other problems detected include:

- use of non-reentrant system functions (e.g., `strtok`) in multi-threaded code;
- use of obsolete functions (e.g., `gethostbyname`);
- incorrect usage of `printf`-style functions;
- incorrect usage of `strcpy`-style functions (e.g., leaving strings without terminating NULL characters);
- incorrect usage of varargs functions;
- different parameter names in function declarations vs. definitions;

Some of these are nastier than others, but they are all legitimate problems and should be fixed.

The full results for both tools are available in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static/tree/master/openmama), so it's easy to compare the warnings against the code.

## Conclusion
The state of the art in static analysis keeps advancing, thanks to people like Daniel Marjam√§ki and the rest of the [cppcheck team](https://github.com/danmar/cppcheck/graphs/contributors), and G√°bor Horv√°th and the [team supporting clang](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/graphs/contributors).

In particular, the latest releases of cppcheck and clang-tidy are detecting errors that previously could only be found by run-time analyzers like valgrind and Address Sanitizer.  This is great stuff, especially given how easy it is to run static analysis on your code.

The benefits of using one (or more) static analysis tools just keep getting more and more compelling -- if you aren't using one of these tools, I hope this will encourage you to do so.

{:toc}

A while back I wrote [an article](/blog/2016/04/07/mo-static/) that compared cppcheck and clang's static analyzers (clang-check and clang-tidy).  The folks who make [PVS-Studio](http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/) (the guys with the unicorn mascot that you've probably been seeing a lot of lately) saw the article, and suggested that I take a look at their Linux port, which was then in beta test, and write about it.

So I did.  Read on for an overview of PVS-Studio, and how it compared to [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/).

<!-- more -->

In [the earlier article](/blog/2016/04/07/mo-static/), I used a [benchmark suite](https://github.com/regehr/itc-benchmarks) developed by Toyota ITC, and written about by [John Regehr](http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1217), who is a professor of Computer Science at the University of Utah.  The ITC suite consists of code that is specially written to exhibit certain errors that can be detected by static analysis, so that the code can be used to evaluate the performance of different tools.

In this article, I am going to use the same test suite to evaluate  PVS-Studio, and to compare it against cppcheck.  I'll also talk about my experience using both tools to analyze two relatively large real-world codebases that I help maintain as part of my day job.

## TL;DR
Using any static analysis tool is better than using none, and in general the more the merrier.  Each tool has its own design philosophy, and corresponding strengths and weaknesses.

Daniel Marjam√§ki[^daniel] and the maintainers of [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) have done a terrific job creating a free tool that can go head-to-head with expensive commercial offerings.  You can't go wrong with cppcheck, either as a gentle introduction to static analysis, or as the one-and-only tool for the budget-conscious.  But don't take my word for it -- the Debian project uses cppcheck as part of its [Debian Automated Code Analysis](https://qa.debian.org/daca/) project to check over 100GB of C++ source code.

[^daniel]: Daniel was recently interviewed on [CppCast](http://cppcast.com/2016/11/daniel-marjamaki/). 

[PVS-Studio](http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/) is also a terrific tool, but it is definitely _not_ free.  (When a product [doesn't have published prices](http://www.viva64.com/en/order/), you know it's going to cost serious money).

Whether PVS-Studio is worth the price is a judgement call, but if it can find just one bug that would have triggered a crash in production it will have paid for itself many times over. 

And while PVS-Studio doesn't appear to have been adopted by a high-profile project like Debian, the folks who make it are certainly not shy about running various open-source projects through their tool and [reporting the results](http://www.viva64.com/en/inspections/).  

So, if your budget can handle it, use both.  If money is a concern, then you may want to start out with cppcheck and use that to help build a case for spending the additional coin that it will take to include commercial tools like PVS-Studio in your toolbox.

Note also that PVS-Studio offers a trial version[^free], so you can give it a go on your own code, which is, after all, the best way to see what the tool can do.  And, if you use the provided [helper scripts](/pages/REAME.md/index.html) ([repo here](https://github.com/btorpey/static)), your results will be in a format that makes it easy to compare the tools.

[^free]: The folks at PVS-Studio asked me to mention that they've also recently introduced a free version of their software for educational purposes. The free version does have some strings attached, see [this post](http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0457/) for details.

## Methodology
In comparing cppcheck and PVS-Studio, I used the ITC test suite that I wrote about in an [earlier article](/blog/2016/04/07/mo-static/).  I also used both tools to analyze real-world code bases which I deal with on a day-to-day basis and that I am intimately familiar with.

### ITC test suite
The ITC test suite that I've been using to compare static analyzers is intended to provide a common set of source files that can be used as input to various static analysis tools.  It includes both real errors, as well as "false positives" intended to trick the tools into flagging legitimate code as an error.

So far, so good, and it's certainly very helpful to know where the errors are (and are not) when evaluating a static analysis tool.  

#### Caveats
In my email discussion with Andrey Karpov of PVS, he made the point that not all bugs are equal, and that a "checklist" approach to comparing static analyzers may not be the best.  I agree, but being able to compare analyzers on the same code-base can be very helpful, not least for getting a feel for how the tools work.

Your mileage can, and will, vary, so it makes sense to get comfortable with different tools and learn what each does best.  And there's no substitute for running the tools on your own code.

##### Specific issues 
The ITC test suite includes some tests for certain categories of errors that are more likely to manifest themselves at run-time, as opposed to compile-time.    

For instance, the ITC suite includes a relatively large number of test cases designed to expose memory-related problems.  These include problems like leaks, double-free's, dangling pointers, etc.

That's all very nice, but in the real world memory errors are often not that clear-cut, and depend on the dynamic behavior of the program at run-time.  Both valgrind's [memcheck](http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#memcheck) and clang's [Address Sanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) do an excellent job of detecting memory errors at run-time, and I use both regularly.

But run-time analyzers can only analyze code that actually runs, and memory errors can hide for quite a long time in code that is rarely executed (e.g., error & exception handlers). So, even though not all memory errors can be caught at compile-time, the ability to detect at least some of them can very helpful.  

A similar situation exists with regard to concurrency (threading) errors -- though in this case neither tool detects *any* of the concurrency-related errors seeded in the ITC code.  This is, I think, a reasonable design decision  -- the subset of threading errors that can be detected at compile-time is so small that it's not really worth doing (and could give users of the tool a false sense of security).  For concurrency errors, you again will probably be better off with something like clang's [Thread Sanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html) or valgrind's [Data Race Detector](http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#drd).

Also, in the interest of full disclosure, I have spot-checked some of the ITC code, but by no means all, to assure myself that its diagnostics were reasonable. 

With those caveats out of the way, though, the ITC test suite does provide at least a good starting point towards a comprehensive set of test cases that can be used to exercise different static analyzers.

The results of running PVS-Studio (and other tools) against the ITC code can be found in the [samples directory of the repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static/tree/master/samples).

## Real-world test results
I also ran both cppcheck and PVS-Studio on the code bases that I maintain as part of my day job, to get an idea of how the tools compare in more of a real-world situation.  While I can't share the detailed comparisons, following are some of the major points.

For the most part, both cppcheck and PVS-Studio reported similar warnings on the same code, with a few exceptions (listed following). 

cppcheck arguably does a better job of flagging "style" issues -- and while some of these warnings are perhaps a bit nit-picky, many are not:

- one-argument ctor's not marked `explicit` 
- functions that can/should be declared `static` or `const`
- use of post-increment on non-primitive types 
- use of obsolete or deprecated functions
- use of C-style casts

PVS-Studio, on the other hand, appears to include more checks for issues that aren't necessarily problems with the use of C++ per se, but things that would be a bug, or at least a "code smell", in any language.

A good example of that is PVS-Studio's warning on similar or identical code sequences (potentially indicating use of the copy-paste anti-pattern -- I've written about that [before](/blog/2014/09/21/repent/)).

Some other PVS-Studio "exclusives" include: 

- classes that define a copy ctor without `operator=`, and vice-versa
- potential floating-point problems[^float], e.g., comparing floating-point values for an exact match using `==`
- empty `catch` clauses
- catching exceptions by value rather than by reference

Both tools did a good job of identifying potentially suspect code, as well as areas where the code could be improved.

[^float]: See [here](http://blog.reverberate.org/2014/09/what-every-computer-programmer-should.html) and [here](http://floating-point-gui.de/) for an explanation of how floating-point arithmetic can produce unexpected results if you're not careful.

## False positives
False positives (warnings on code that is actually correct) are not really a problem with either cppcheck or PVS-Studio.  The few warnings that could be classified as false positives indicate code that is at the very least suspect -- in most cases you're going to want to change the code anyway, if only to make it clearer.

If you still get more false positives than you can comfortably deal with, or if you want to stick with a particular construct even though it may be suspect, both tools have mechanisms to suppress individual warnings, or whole classes of errors.  Both tools are also able to silence warnings either globally, or down to the individual line of code, based on inline comments.

## Conclusion
If you care about building robust, reliable code in C++ then you would be well-rewarded to include static analysis as part of your development work-flow.  

Both [PVS-Studio](http://www.viva64.com/en/pvs-studio/) and [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) do an excellent job of identifying potential problems in your code.  It's almost like having another set of eyeballs to do code review, but with the patience to trace through all the possible control paths, and with a voluminous knowledge of the language, particularly the edge cases and "tricky bits".

Having said that, I want to be clear that static analysis is not a substitute for the dynamic analsyis provided by tools like valgrind's [memcheck](http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#memcheck) and [Data Race Detector](http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#drd), or clang's [Address Sanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) and [Thread Sanitizer](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/ThreadSanitizer.html).  You'll want to use them too, as there are certain classes of bugs that can only be detected at run-time.

## Appendix: Helper scripts and sample results

I've posted the [helper scripts](/pages/REAME.md/index.html) I used to run PVS-Studio, as well as the results of running those scripts on the ITC code, in the [repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static).

## Appendix: Detailed test results

The following sections describe a subset of the tests in the ITC code and how both tools respond to them.

### Bit Shift errors
{:.no_toc}
For the most part, PVS-Studio and cpphceck both do a good job of detecting errors related to bit shifts. Neither tool detects all the errors seeded in the benchmark code, although they miss different errors.

### Buffer overrun/underrun errors
{:.no_toc}
cppcheck appears to do a more complete job than PVS-Studio of detecting buffer overrrun and underrun errors, although it is sometimes a bit "off" -- reporting errors on lines that are in the vicinity of the actual error, rather than on the actual line.  cppcheck also reports calls to functions that generate buffer errors, which is arguably redundant, but does no harm.

PVS-Studio catches some of the seeded errors, but misses several that cppcheck detects.

While not stricly speaking an overrun error, cppcheck can also detect some errors where code overwrites the last byte in a null-terminated string.

### Conflicting/redundant conditions
{:.no_toc}
Both cppcheck and PVS-Studio do a good job of detecting conditionals that always evaluate to either true or false, with PVS-Studio being a bit better at detecting complicated conditions composed of contstants.

On the other hand, cppcheck flags redundant conditions (e.g., `if (i<5 && i<10)`), which PVS-Studio doesn't do. 

### Loss of integer precision
{:.no_toc}
Surprisingly, neither tool does a particularly good job of detecting loss of integer precision (the proverbial "ten pounds of bologna in a five-pound sack" problem ;-)

#### Assignments
{:.no_toc}
I say surprisingly because these kinds of errors would seem to be relatively easy to detect.  Where both tools seem to fall short is to assume that just because a value fits in the target data type, the assignment is valid -- but they fail to take into account that such an assignment can lose precision.

I wanted to convince myself that the ITC code was correct, so I pasted some of the code into a small test program:

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

When you run this program, you'll get the following output:

    $ gcc test1.c && ./a.out
    Value of sink=-128

So, `a` has the value 128, but when `a` is assigned to the (signed) char `ret`,  the bit pattern `0x80` is interpreted in the context of a (signed) char, and the sign is lost.  If `ret` had been declared as an unsigned char, then the assigment would not lose the sign of `a`.

#### Arithmetic expressions
{:.no_toc}
cppcheck does do a slightly better job of detecting integer overflow and underflow in arithmetic expressions compared to PVS, but still misses a number of seeded errors.

#### Divide by zero
{:.no_toc}
Both PVS-Studio and cppcheck do a good job of catching potential divide-by-zero errors, with cppcheck having a slight edge. 

### Dead code
{:.no_toc}
PVS-Studio tends to do a somewhat better job than cppcheck at detecting various types of dead code, such as `for` loops and `if` statements where the condition will never be true.

PVS-Studio also very helpfully flags any unconditional `break` statements in a loop -- these are almost always going to be a mistake.

### Concurrency
{:.no_toc}
As mentioned above, neither tool detects *any* of the concurrency-related errors seeded in the ITC code.  Again, I regard that as a reasonable design choice, given the relatively small percentage of such errors that can be detected at compile-time.

### Memory Errors
{:.no_toc}
As discussed earlier, not all memory errors can be detected at compile-time, so the lack of any error output certainly doesn't mean that the code doesn't have memory errors -- it just means that they can't be detected by the tools. But while many memory errors cannot be detected at compile-time, for those that can be, detecting them is a big win.

#### Double free
{:.no_toc}
cppcheck does an excellent job of detecting double-free errors (11 out of 12), while PVS-Studio only flags one of the seeded errors.

#### Free-ing non-allocated memory
{:.no_toc}
On the other hand, PVS-Studio does a better job of detecting attempts to free memory that was not allocated dynamically (e.g., local variables).  

#### Freeing a NULL pointer
{:.no_toc}
Neither tool does a particularly good job of catching these.  Perhaps that is because freeing a NULL pointer is actually not an error, but doing so is certainly a clue that the code may have other problems.

#### Dangling pointers
{:.no_toc}
cppcheck does a somewhat better job of detecting the use of dangling pointers (where the pointed-to object has already been freed).

#### Allocation failures
{:.no_toc}
If you're writing code for an embedded system, then checking for and handling allocation failures can be important, because your application is likely written to expect them, and do something about them.  But more commonly, running out of memory simply means that you're screwed, and attempting to deal with the problem is unlikely to make things better.

Neither tool detects code that doesn't handle allocation failures, but cppcheck does flag some allocation-related problems (as leaks, which is not correct, but it is a clue that there is a problem lurking).

#### Memory Leaks
{:.no_toc}
Typically, memory leaks are only evident at run-time, but there are some cases where they can be detected at compile-time, and in those cases cppcheck does a pretty good job. 

#### Null pointer
{:.no_toc}
Both PVS-Studio and cppcheck do a good job of flagging code that dereferences a NULL pointer, although neither tool catches all the errors in the benchmark code.

#### Returning a pointer to a local variable
{:.no_toc}
Both PVS-Studio and cppcheck detect returning a pointer to a local variable that is allocated on the stack.

#### Accessing un-initialized memory
{:.no_toc}
PVS-Studio does a somewhat better job than cppcheck of flagging accesses to uninitialized memory.

### Infinite loops
{:.no_toc}
Both cppcheck and PVS-Studio detect some infinite loop errors, but miss several others.  It could be that this is by design, since the code that is not flagged tends to resemble some idioms (e.g., ` while (true)`) that are often used deliberately.  

### Ignored return values
{:.no_toc}
PVS-Studio is quite clever here -- it will complain about an unused return value from a function, *if* it can determine that the function has no side effects.  It also knows about some common STL functions that do not have side effects, and will warn if their return values are ignored.

cppcheck doesn't check for return values per se, but it will detect an assignment that is never referenced.  This makes some sense, since warning on ignored return values could result in a large number of false positives.

### Empty/short blocks
{:.no_toc}
Both tools detect certain cases of empty blocks (e.g., `if (...);` -- note the trailing semi-colon).  

What neither tool does is warn about "short" blocks -- where a conditional block is not enclosed in braces, and so it's not 100% clear whether the conditional is meant to cover more than one statement:


    if (...)
       statement1();
       statement2();

If you've adopted a convention that even single-statement blocks need to be enclosed in braces, then this situation may not pertain (and good for you!).  Still, I think this would be a worthwhile addition -- at least in the "style" category.

### Dead stores
{:.no_toc}
cppcheck does a particularly good job of detecting dead stores (where an assignment is never subsequently used).  PVS-Studio, on the other hand, flags two or more consecutive assignments to a variable, without an intervening reference.  PVS-Studio will also flag assignment of a variable to itself (which is unlikely to be what was intended).

- Will be replaced with the ToC, excluding the "Contents" header
{:toc}

In my day job, one of my main focuses is software reliability and correctness, so it makes sense that I would be a big fan of static analysis.

I've written previously about the [static analysis provided by clang](/blog/2015/04/27/static-analysis-with-clang/).  Today, I want to take a bit of a "deep-dive" into the whole subject by putting both clang and [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) through their paces, using them to analyze a benchmark suite designed to exercise static analysis tools.  In the course of doing that, I'll also provide some helper scripts that make working with the tools easier.  

<!-- more -->

## Testing Static Analysis Tools

>  And what is good Phaedrus, and what is not good -- need we ask anyone to tell us these things? [^zen]  

[^zen]: Robert Pirsig, "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"

Obviously, the ultimate goal is to be able to run static analysis tools against our own codebase(s) to help detect and fix problems.  But how do we know if a particular tool is actually finding problems?  And, how do we know if we're running the tool properly?  

The perfect static analyzer would find all the latent bugs in our code, while not reporting any false positives[^fpos].  Since there are no perfect analyzers, any tool we use is going to miss some errors, and/or wrongly flag correct code.  So, the only way to evaluate an analyzer is to know where all the bugs are in our code -- but if we knew that, we wouldn't need an analyzer.

[^fpos]: A "false positive" is when a tool reports an error that is actually not.

That's a dilemma. To resolve it, we're going to be using a codebase specifically designed to trigger static analysis warnings.  The code was originally developed by Toyota ITC, and is available on [John Regehr's excellent blog](http://blog.regehr.org/archives/1217).  

The ITC benchmarks attempt to resolve our dilemma by providing both a set of code that contains errors which *should* trigger warnings, as well as a second set of code, similar to the first, but which doesn't contain errors.  Each source file is annotated with comments documenting where the errors are (and aren't).  And that lets us create a catalog of both real errors and potential false positives[^disclaimer]. 

To get started, download the code from [its GitHub repository](https://github.com/regehr/itc-benchmarks), and set the `ITCBENCH_ROOT` environment variable (which will come in handy later):

    $ git clone https://github.com/regehr/itc-benchmarks
    $ export ITCBENCH_ROOT=$(pwd)/itc-benchmarks

## Can I haz teh codez?
The remainder of this article goes step-by-step through the process of creating a compilation database from the ITC benchmark code, running clang's static analysis tools against that compilation database, building and installing cppcheck and running it against the compilation database, and analyzing the results.

This is all good stuff, especially if you're going to be using these tools going forward.  But, there's a certain amount of unavoidable yak-shaving[^yak] going on to get to that point.  So if you prefer to skip all that, I've included the results of running the different tools in the samples directory of the [repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static).  The samples include all the files we're going to be generating the hard way, so you can follow along without all the requisite busy-work.  Hopefully, when we're done you'll want to go back and use these tools on your own codebase. 

[^yak]: See <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving> for a description of this colorful term.

## Creating a compilation database
To run both clang and cppcheck we first need to create a "compilation database" to supply them with required build settings.  The [compilation database](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) format was developed as part of the clang project, to provide a way for different tools to query the actual options used to build each file.

A [good overview of how the compilation database works](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2014/05/21/compilation-databases-for-clang-based-tools) with clang-based tools can be found at Eli Bendersky's excellent site.  His article illustrates the importance of making sure that code analysis tools are looking at the same (pre-processed) source that the actual compiler sees, in order to generate meaningful diagnostics with a minimum of false positives.

- If you are using [cmake](http://cmake.org/) to drive your builds, creating a compilation database couldn't be easier -- simply add the `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` parameter to the cmake build command, or add the following to your main CMakeLists.txt file:

    `set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)`

- If you're not using cmake, you can still create a compilation database using plain old make by front-ending make with [Bear](<https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear>)[^bear], like so:

    `bear make`

In either case, the end result should be the creation of a  `compile_commands.json` file in the current directory.

Sadly, the ITC benchmark suite is stuck in the past using [autotools](https://twitter.com/timmartin2/status/23365017839599616), and worse yet, a version that needs to be installed from source (on RH6, at least).     

So, in the interest of immediate gratification, I've included the compile\_commands.json file [here](/downloads/code/static/samples/compile_commands.json) -- simply save it to the directory where you've cloned the ITC code.  (The compile_commands.json file is also contained in the samples directory of the [repo for this article](https://github.com/btorpey/static)).

If you prefer to generate the compile_commands.json file yourself using Bear, you can do so like this:

    $ cd ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}  
    $ ./bootstrap
    $ ./configure
    $ bear make

[^bear]: Building and installing Bear from source is relatively straightforward -- just keep in mind that you need python >= 2.7.

## Establishing a baseline
To make it possible to compare results from different analyzers, we first need to establish a baseline using the ITC benchmarks, and for that we're going to need [this set of helper scripts](/pages/REAME.md/index.html), which can be downloaded from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/btorpey/static).

    $ git clone https://github.com/btorpey/static
    
Once you've done that, you need to add the directory to your PATH:

    $ export PATH=$(pwd)/static/scripts:$PATH 

Enter the following command from the ITC source directory to create a csv file with the error annotations from the ITC code:

    $ cd ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}  
    $ cc_driver.pl -n grep -Hni ERROR: | 
    itc2csv.pl -r ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}/ | 
    sort -u > itc.csv  


The command will create a file named `itc.csv` in the source directory that looks like this:

    $ cat itc.csv
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:106","/*ERROR:Bit shift error*/"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:120","/*ERROR:Bit shift error*/"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:133","/*ERROR:Bit shift error*/"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:146","/*ERROR:Bit shift error*/"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:163","/*ERROR:Bit shift error*/"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:175","/*ERROR:Bit shift error*/"
    ...

The format of the csv file is really simple -- just an entry for file and line number, and another with the error annotation munged from the source file.  This will give us a baseline against which to compare both clang and cppcheck.


## Using clang's analysis tools

In a couple of previous posts, I wrote about [static analysis with clang](/blog/2015/04/27/static-analysis-with-clang), and [how to build clang](/blog/2015/01/02/building-clang).  This next bit assumes that you've got clang ready-to-go, but if that's not the case, there can be a fair amount of work required to get to that point, so you may want to skip ahead to the section on [using cppcheck](#using-cppcheck).

We're going to use a similar approach to the one we used above to generate the list of expected errors from the ITC code.  The command below will run clang-check against all the files in compile_commands.json, filter the results, and reformat the output in csv format:

    $ cd ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}  
    $ cc_driver.pl clang-check -analyze 2>&1 | 
    clang2csv.pl -r ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}/ |
    sort -u > clangcheck.csv

This gives us the diagnostic messages produced by clang, in the same csv format as we used for the list of errors, above: 

    $ cat clangcheck.csv
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:106","warning: The result of the '<<' expression is undefined"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:133","warning: The result of the '<<' expression is undefined"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:146","warning: The result of the '<<' expression is undefined"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:163","warning: The result of the '<<' expression is undefined"
    "01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:175","warning: The result of the '<<' expression is undefined"
    ...

We can already see that there are some differences: the ITC code expects to see a diagnostic at 01.w_Defects/bit_shift.c:120, but clang doesn't output a warning for that line.

### Analyzing the results

What I like to do at this point is fire up my all-time favorite tool, [Beyond Compare](/blog/2013/01/29/beyond-compare/), to generate a visual diff of the two files:

<img class="center" src="/images/itcvsclang.png"> 

This view shows the expected diagnostics extracted from the ITC source files on the left, alongside the diagnostics generated by clang on the right.  We can see that clang catches some of the bugs in the source file, but misses others.  If we continue to read down the two files, we'll also see some potential "false positives" -- i.e., diagnostics issued by clang that are not marked as expected errors in the source files. 

The visual approach using Beyond Compare works well for me, but with a csv-formatted datafile, other approaches are possible as well.  We could import the diagnostic messages into a spreadsheet program, or even a DBMS, for archiving, tracking and comparison. 

## Running clang analysis (again)
clang actually has two tools for doing static analysis -- in the example above we ran `clang-check -analyze`, but now we're going to use `clang-tidy` instead.

    $ cd ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}  
    $ cc_driver.pl clang-tidy 2>&1 | 
    clang2csv.pl -r ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}/ | 
    sort -u > clangtidy.csv

If you compare the results from clang-check and clang-tidy, you'll notice that clang-tidy generally reports more warnings than clang-check.  Some of them are not necessarily defects, but are arguably bad practice (e.g., using `strcpy`).

<img class="center" src="/images/clangcheckvstidy.png"> 

clang-tidy also outputs a slightly different format, including the name of the check in brackets.  (The name can also be used to suppress the warning).

The choice of which to use is up to you -- my preference is to use clang-check first, and follow up with clang-tidy, simply because the warnings produced by clang-tidy either duplicate those from clang-check, or are not as serious.

Note that you can get a list of available checks from clang with the following command:

    $ clang -cc1 -analyzer-checker-help
    ...
    core.DivideZero                 Check for division by zero
    core.DynamicTypePropagation     Generate dynamic type information
    core.NonNullParamChecker        Check for null pointers passed as arguments to a function whose arguments are references or marked with the 'nonnull' attribute
    core.NullDereference            Check for dereferences of null pointers
    core.StackAddressEscape         Check that addresses to stack memory do not escape the function


## Using cppcheck

There's another static analysis tool that can provide results comparable to clang.  [cppcheck](http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/) has been around for a while, and I had tried to get it working in the past, but had given up after bumping into a few problems.

I kept hearing good things about cppcheck in [articles and presentations by others](#references), though, so I finally decided it would be worth the trouble to get it working.

It turns out the problems were not that difficult to solve, given a combination of documentation and experimentation.  And the benefits were significant, so I'm quite happy to have added cppcheck to my tool box.

### Installing cppchceck
While cppcheck is available bundled with some distros, it's often an older version, so we're going to build and install it from source. As is more and more often the case, cppcheck has started using features of C++1x, so we're going to need a C++1x-capable compiler to build it.

If you're on an older distro (in my case, RH6) where the system compiler is not C++1x-capable, see my [earlier post](/blog/2015/01/02/building-clang/) about how to build clang (and/or gcc) to get a C++1x-capable compiler.  (Basically, it uses an older version of gcc to build a newer version, and the newer version to build clang).  

It took some trial-and-error to get the cppcheck build parameters right, but the [supplied build script](/pages/build_cppcheck.sh/index.html) should get the job done[^install].

    $ ./build_cppcheck.sh 2>&1 | tee build_cppcheck.out

[^install]: As usual, I prefer installing external packages in a non-standard location, so the build script is set up to do that.  See [this post](/blog/2015/01/02/building-clang/) for an explanation and rationale of this approach).

#### Verifying the installation
You'll need to add the cppcheck directory to your PATH (assuming the install location from the build script):

    $ export PATH=/build/share/cppcheck/1.73/bin:$PATH

If the build and install process worked, you should be able to invoke cppcheck from the command line, like so:

    $ cppcheck --version
    Cppcheck 1.73
 
If you see the message below instead, there's a problem with the RPATH setting:
   
    $ cppcheck --version
    cppcheck: /usr/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found (required by cppcheck)

The problem is typically either that the RPATH setting in the build is incorrect, or that the directory referenced by the RPATH setting does not exist.

### Running cppcheck

Now we're ready to run cppcheck, using the same approach we used with clang: 

    $ cd ${ITCBENCH_ROOT}  
    $ cc_driver.pl cppcheck.sh  2>&1 | 
    cppcheck2csv.pl -r ${ITCBENCH_ROOT} | 
    sort -u > cppcheck.csv

Note that instead of invoking cppcheck directly, we're invoking it via the [cppcheck.sh](/pages/cppcheck.sh/index.html) helper script, which supplies needed parameters to cppcheck.  It also creates an include file with the compiler's pre-defined macros, so those definitions will be visible to cppcheck.  This turns out to be particularly important with cppcheck, especially if the code you're trying to analyze uses `#ifdef`'s to control what code actually gets compiled (or seen by cppcheck)[^nosys].

[^nosys]: Note that cppcheck does not particularly like it when you include system include directories using `-I`.  Accordingly, we don't pass the `-s` switch to  cc_driver.pl when running cppcheck.

One of the settings in the helper script enables what cppcheck calls "inconclusive" results.  These are exactly what the name implies -- cppcheck isn't positive that the code is wrong, but it is at least suspicious.  Including these inconclusive results should tend to increase the number of false positives in theory, but in practice I haven't found false positives to be a big problem with either cppcheck or clang.  

### Analyzing the results
One of the first things you notice with cppcheck is that it includes more checks than clang.  Some of the additional warnings are for constructs that are not exactly *wrong*, but are either non-optimal, or indicators of potential problems.  For instance, cppcheck will warn when a variable is defined in a broader scope than is actually required ("scope ... can be reduced").  

<img class="center" src="/images/itcvscppcheck.png"> 

You can get a list of all the checks cppcheck is performing like so:

    $ cppcheck --doc 
    ...
    ## Other ##
    Other checks
    - division with zero
    - scoped object destroyed immediately after construction
    - assignment in an assert statement
    - free() or delete of an invalid memory location
    - bitwise operation with negative right operand
    - provide wrong dimensioned array to pipe() system command (--std=posix)


You can also generate a list of error ID's with this command:

    $ cppcheck --errorlist
    <error id="stringLiteralWrite" severity="error" msg="Modifying string literal directly or indirectly is undefined behaviour."/>
    <error id="sprintfOverlappingData" severity="error" msg="Undefined behavior: Variable &apos;varname&apos; is used as parameter and destination in s[n]printf()."/>
    <error id="strPlusChar" severity="error" msg="Unusual pointer arithmetic. A value of type &apos;char&apos; is added to a string literal."/>
    <error id="incorrectStringCompare" severity="style" msg="String literal &quot;Hello World&quot; doesn&apos;t match length argument for substr()."/>
    <error id="literalWithCharPtrCompare" severity="style" msg="String literal compared with variable &apos;foo&apos;. Did you intend to use strcmp() instead?"/>
    <error id="charLiteralWithCharPtrCompare" severity="style" msg="Char literal compared with pointer &apos;foo&apos;. Did you intend to dereference it?"/>
    <error id="incorrectStringBooleanError" severity="style" msg="Conversion of string literal &quot;Hello World&quot; to bool always evaluates to true."/>
 

You can suppress any errors you don't care to see by passing its id in the `--suppress=` flag.

## Comparing clang and cppcheck
There's a school of thought that says you should use as many compilers as possible to build your code, because each one will find different problems.  That's still a good idea, and even more so with static analysis tools.  

There's a certain amount of overlap between clang and cppcheck, but there are also significant differences.  In my experience, if clang reports something as a problem, it almost certainly is one, but clang also misses a lot of problems that it could detect.

<img class="center" src="/images/clangvscppcheck.png"> 

cppcheck can generate more warnings, and some of them are more stylistic issues, but it does detect certain classes of problems, like dead code and arithmetic over/underflow, that clang doesn't.

As I mentioned earlier, I haven't found false positives to be a major problem with either clang or cppcheck.

So, each tool has its place, and I like to use both.

# Conclusions
Static analysis tools can add real value to the software development process by detecting errors, especially errors in code that is never or almost never executed.

Commercial tools can be expensive (although still cheap compared to the money they save), and open-source tools can sometimes be hard to use (or at least hard to learn how to use).

The provided [helper scripts](/pages/REAME.md/index.html) ([repo here](https://github.com/btorpey/static)) should make it much easier to use these tools, and to keep track of warnings and compare the outputs of different tools by using a common format.

They can also be useful for before-and-after comparisions of different versions of a single codebase -- for example, as changes are being made to address issues detected by the tools.

# Acknowledgements
In addition to the people, projects and organizations mentioned earlier, the people at the NIST have been very helpful, and maintain an incredible collection of resources on the topic of static analysis for a number of languages, not just C++.  Some of those resources include the following, and are well worth checking out:

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/coil3.jpg" width="195" height="281">

I keep singing the praises of clang, and with good reason -- the [clang project](<http://clang.llvm.org/>) has been advancing the state of C/C++ compiler technology on Linux and OS X for quite a while now.  

The modular design of the compiler has also enabled the creation of a set of ancillary tools, including run-time "sanitizers" (which I [wrote about earlier](http://btorpey.github.io/blog/2014/03/27/using-clangs-address-sanitizer/)), as well as pretty-printers, and a tool to automatically upgrade code to C++11. 

Today I want to talk about clang's static analysis engine, which can do a deep-dive on your code and find problems that are hard for a human to detect, but that are amenable to a brute-force approach that models the run-time behavior of a piece of code, but at compile-time.

<!-- more -->

This is very different from dynamic analysis tools, like valgrind and clang's own sanitizers, which instrument the code at run-time to detect actual errors (e.g., reading uninitialized memory) that happen while the code is running.  With dynamic analysis, the only errors that can be detected are in code that is actually executed, so a latent bug that only manifests under unusual conditions[^heisenbug], can go un-detected.  By contrast, static analysis can potentially find bugs in code that is never (or almost never) actually executed.  

[^heisenbug]:  These are often called "Heisenbugs", in a nerd-humor pun on the [Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle>).

Sounds good, no?  Who wouldn't want to find bugs "automagically", without even needing to do any testing.  (Cause we all know how much programmers love testing ;-)

For example, running clang's static analyzer on some sample code turns up warnings similar to the following:

- Value stored to 'x' is never read
- The right operand of '!=' is a garbage value
- Potential leak of memory pointed to by 'x'
- Function call argument is an uninitialized value
- Use of memory after it is freed
- Called C++ object pointer is null

Some of the above warnings (e.g., value stored is never read) are most likely harmless, and just sloppy coding (perhaps because of copy-paste syndrome, about which I have more to say [here](http://btorpey.github.io/blog/2014/09/21/repent/)).  Others (e.g., called pointer is null), might be false positives, given the algorithms the analyzer uses[^falsepos].  Or, they could be real bugs that you just haven't hit yet, because the code is (almost) never executed.

[^falsepos]:  For instance, clang's analayzer attempts to figure out if a pointer can possibly be NULL by seeing if there is any code that checks for that condition.  If there is, then clang complains about any code that dereferences the pointer outside an `if (x != NULL)` block.  This algorithm isn't perfect, but it's about the best that can be done, especially since the analyzer only looks at a single file at a time.

Those are the really scary bugs, along with the ones where you can "get lucky" most of the time ... except when you don't.  The "garbage value" and "unitialized value" warnings fall into that category, and can be very hard to eyeball.  Again, dynamic analysis tools like valgrind can help find these bugs, but only if you hit that code in testing.

So, static analysis *is* good, but it's not magic.  Static analyzers can only find bugs that they are programmed to find, and they certainly don't find all bugs.  For instance, here's a bug that clang's static analysis doesn't find:

<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

But the fact is that static analysis *will* find bugs, and it will find bugs that you most likely wouldn't find on your own, so it's a a good tool to have in your toolbox.  So, let's take a look at how to do that using clang.

The first step is to install clang.  If you're on OS X or Ubuntu, you should already have it, but if you're on RedHat this can be a bit tricky, so see [my previous post](http://btorpey.github.io/blog/2015/01/02/building-clang/) on how to get clang working.  (I've updated that post to add instructions for installing some of the static analysis tools that don't normally get installed with clang).

It turns out that there are three (3) different ways to run clang's static analyzer on your code, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.  We'll consider each of these in turn:

## Integrated with a typical build

If you use reasonably normal-looking makefiles to build your code, you can get static analysis going with a minimum of fuss.  If you're using cmake to create your makefiles, the same approach will work fine, so long as you're not overriding the values of CMAKE_C_COMPILER etc.  (And, as usual, if you're using autotools, [you're on your own;-)](https://twitter.com/timmartin2/status/23365017839599616).  

In this approach, you `export` some environment variables to invoke the analyzer instead of the compiler, like the following:

Variable|Value       |Meaning
--------|------------|-------
CC|ccc-analyzer|C compiler is redirected to clang analyzer (which in turn invokes the compiler, using the value of CCC_CC, below).
CXX|c++-analyzer|Similar to above, but for C++.
CCC_CC|clang|This environment variable is used by ccc-analyzer to invoke the actual C compiler.
CCC_CXX|clang++|ditto
LD|clang++|Specifies that the actual compiler should be used for linking.
CCC\_ANALYZER_VERBOSE|1|(Optional) Set this flag to get verbose output from the analyzer, including the list of errors checked.

<br>
With those variables set, you should just be able to invoke `make` to build your project, and Bob's your uncle.

One nice thing about this approach is that you get both compiler warnings and analyzer warnings together -- first, the analyzer invokes the compiler on the source file, and then performs the static analysis.

## Using the GUI tool

In a similar fashion as ccc-analyzer (above) front-ends make, you can use clang's [scan-build](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/scan-build.html) tool to front-end ccc-analyzer. In addition to invoking the compiler and analyzer, scan-build also collects the analyzer reports, including the control flow that the analyzer used to infer any errors, and presents that using a set of html pages that are written by default to the /tmp directory, and that look like this:

![](http://clang-analyzer.llvm.org/images/analyzer_html.png)

Personally, I find this fascinating.  Not only does the analyzer tell about what it thinks is a problem, but also *why* it thinks so.  

In the example above, you can see the steps that the analyzer follows to figure out that there is a problem with the code.  If you are wondering whether a particular warning is a false positive or not, this presentation can help you figure that out.  [^false2] It can also sometimes provide unexpected insights into the code that you might not come up with on your own.

To use this approach, you set your environment variables the same as described above, but instead of running make, you run `scan-build -V make`.  This will run your build and then launch a browser to view the results of the build.

### A small hitch...

Unfortunately, scan-build (and its scan-view companion) are not installed by default with clang.  I've updated the build script from my [earlier post](http://btorpey.github.io/blog/2015/01/02/building-clang/) on building clang on RedHat to install these files, but if you want to do it manually, run the following from the source tree you used to build and install clang:

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>
 
### Another small hitch...
In an [earlier post](http://btorpey.github.io/blog/2015/03/17/shadow/), I talked about how to use the `-isystem` flag to prevent selected headers from generating warnings.  Unfortunately, the [clang analyzer chokes on that flag](https://llvm.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=13237#c9) -- so if you're using it, you will need to apply the patch below to successfully run the analyzer.  

<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

[^false2]: At least in my experience, many of the warnings that appear at first to be false positives turn out to be real bugs, especially if you follow through the control flow the analyzer uses.

## Using a compilation database

Last but not least, you can also use a "compilation database" to invoke the static analyzer directly.  So, what is a compilation database, you ask?  This is a [simple format](http://clang.llvm.org/docs/JSONCompilationDatabase.html) introduced by clang that records the actual commands used to generate intermediate build products from source files, along with their parameters.

The analyzer needs this information to reproduce the environment used by the compiler, including pre-processor definitions and include file search paths.  

If you are using [cmake](http://cmake.org/) to drive your builds, creating a compilation database couldn't be easier -- simply add the `-DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS=ON` parameter to the cmake build command, or add the following to your main CMakeLists.txt file:

`set(CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS ON)`

If you're not using cmake, you can still create a compilation database using plain old make by front-ending make with [Bear](<https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear>)[^bear], like so:

`bear make`

This will use Bear to drive the make process, leaving a `compile_commands.json` file in the current directory.

[^bear]: Building and installing Bear from source is relatively straightforward -- just keep in mind that you need python >= 2.7.

Once you've got the compilation database, invoking the analyzer can be done with a command like the following:

<div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">COMPILE_DB</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="k">$(</span>/bin/pwd<span class="k">)</span>;
</span><span class='line'>grep file compile_commands.json |
</span><span class='line'>awk <span class="s1">&#39;{ print $2; }&#39;</span> |
</span><span class='line'>sed <span class="s1">&#39;s/\&quot;//g&#39;</span> |
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">while </span><span class="nb">read </span>FILE; <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">(</span><span class="nb">cd</span> <span class="k">$(</span>dirname <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">FILE</span><span class="k">})</span>;
</span><span class='line'>   clang-check -analyze -p <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">COMPILE_DB</span><span class="k">}</span> <span class="k">$(</span>basename <span class="k">${</span><span class="nv">FILE</span><span class="k">})</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="o">)</span>;
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">done</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

(There are simpler ways to invoke the analyzer, but the approach shown here will visit each source file in the same order that it was originally built, which can be handy).


## Conclusion
As we said earlier, static analysis is not magic, and it certainly won't find all your bugs.  But it will probably find some, and the ones it finds are likely to be nasty, so it's worth a certain amount of trouble.

Last but not least, this is by no means a complete explanation of clang's analyzer.  Like much of clang, the documentation lags the code, sometimes by a lot, so much of this information was obtained by trial-and-error, and/or by reading the code.  So, if you find something interesting, please [drop me a line](<mailto:wallstprog@gmail.com>), or leave a note in the comments section.
