You know those mutiple-choice tests that put you in one of four quadrants based
on your answers to a bunch of seemingly irrelevant questions? We've all taken
them, and if you're like me they're kind of like reading your horoscope -- it
all seems so right and true when you're reading it, but you wonder if it would
still seem just as right and true if the horoscopes got jumbled at random?

Well, I took one of these tests a while back that actually told me something about myself -- it was the "Learning-Style Inventory"
test, and what it said about me is that I'm waaaayyy over at the end of the
scale when it comes to visual thinking. That gave me an insight into the way my
brain works that I've found really helpful ever since. So, this next bit was right up my alley,
but I'm guessing you'll like it too.

We read a lot lately about NUMA architecture and how it presents a fundamental
change in the way we approach writing efficient code: it's no longer about the
CPU, it's all about RAM. We all nod and say "Sure, I get that!"  Well, I thought
I got it too, but until I saw [this web page](<http://www.overbyte.com.au/misc/Lesson3/CacheFun.html>), 
I really didn't.
